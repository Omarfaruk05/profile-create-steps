## Project Name: [Create User Steps](https://create-user-steps-frontend.vercel.app)

### In this project, I have created a user and complete his/ her profile. On the signing page, a user must give his name, a unique username, a unique email, password. Then he can create his/her account. Then the page redirects to the image upload and and bio page. In this project, I used imgBB for image hosting. If a user gives his/her image and gives his/her bio then the user can be able to proceed the next page. This page is a user role select page. This page user can select multiple role and complete his/her account. And lastly user info and token is saved into localsotrage.
